# orderdisplay_sqlproject2
This project was a green screen full-stack build incorporating Angular on the front-side and then Node.js 
and express.js with a SQL database on the back-end. It incorporated much of the material we had covered
at Prime the last few days. With Angular, we were asked to incorporate different views, different controllers, 
and Angular routing. I also elected to include a factory to get practice at using them.

On the back-end, we had to construct calls to a SQL database to get certain information which would display
on the DOM on the front-end.
